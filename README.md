# Moomba-Autonomous-Wandering-Vehicle
The goal of this project was to design a real time operating system for an autonomous vehicle. This lead to the creation of the Moomba, which will autonomously wander throughout a space. It was created using TI's SYS/BIOS on a piccolo F28027 processor.

Hardware:
  
  TI F28027 development board x1
  
  L298N Motor Driver x1
  
  6v DC motors x4
  
  HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging module x1
  
  6v NI-MH battery x1
